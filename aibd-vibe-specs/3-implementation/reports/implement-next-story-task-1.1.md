## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. Copied `recipes.json` from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/sample-data/` to `/workspace/src/assets/recipes.json`
2. Copied `ingredients.json` from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/sample-data/` to `/workspace/src/assets/ingredients.json`
3. Copied `tags.json` from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/sample-data/` to `/workspace/src/assets/tags.json`
4. Created `/workspace/src/assets/images/` directory and copied all 9 recipe images from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/sample-data/images/` to the new location
5. Updated story status from "Approved" to "Done" in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/stories/story-1.1.md`
6. Marked all tasks and subtasks as completed in the story file
7. Added comprehensive completion summary with implementation details

### ✅ Quality Checks Passed:

- **TypeScript compilation** - PASSED: Project builds successfully with `pnpm run build` (zero errors, clean artifacts generated)
- **ESLint** - PASSED: All files pass linting with `pnpm run lint` (no errors or warnings)
- **Circular dependency check** - PASSED: No circular dependencies found with `pnpm run madge`
- **Build verification after assets** - PASSED: Final build completed successfully with all assets included in `/workspace/dist/in/browser/assets/`

### ✅ Story Requirements Met:

- **AC1: Project builds successfully** - Project builds without errors using `pnpm run build`, generating clean artifacts in `/workspace/dist/in/`
- **AC2: No circular dependencies** - Verified using `pnpm run madge` with zero circular dependencies detected
- **AC3: Linting passes** - All files pass ESLint validation with no errors or warnings
- **AC4: JSON data files present** - All three required files (recipes.json, ingredients.json, tags.json) successfully copied to `src/assets/`
- **AC5: Recipe images present** - All 9 recipe images copied from sample-data to `src/assets/images/` and verified in build output

The story has been moved to **Done** status and is ready for feature development. The implementation successfully addresses the original project foundation setup requirements, establishing a stable development environment with proper asset organization and build system verification.
