## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Created main-layout feature directory structure** following AIBD architecture guidelines:
   - `/src/features/main-layout/` - Feature root directory
   - `/src/features/main-layout/internal/` - Private implementation directory

2. **Implemented DTO type definitions** for raw JSON data structures:
   - `/src/features/main-layout/internal/recipe-dto.ts` - RecipeDTO and RecipeIngredientDTO types
   - `/src/features/main-layout/internal/ingredient-dto.ts` - IngredientDTO type
   - `/src/features/main-layout/internal/tag-dto.ts` - TagDTO type

3. **Created AIBD Simple Store implementation** with complete state management:
   - `/src/features/main-layout/internal/main-layout-store.ts` - MainLayoutStore with MainLayoutStoreDesign type alias
   - Implemented signalState with MainLayoutState containing recipes, ingredients, tags, selectedIngredients, selectedRecipe, isLoading, and error
   - Created computed selectors for filteredRecipes (ALL selected ingredients logic) and suggestedIngredients
   - Implemented loadData rxMethod effect using forkJoin for parallel JSON loading from assets
   - Added complete DTO to VM conversion with ingredient emoji and tag color enrichment
   - Implemented all state management actions: addIngredient, removeIngredient, clearAllIngredients, setSelectedRecipe, clearSelectedRecipe

4. **Created HeroSection presentational component**:
   - `/src/features/main-layout/internal/hero-section.ts` - Hero section with gradient title and description
   - Implemented inline template with Tailwind CSS styling and animations
   - Used OnPush change detection strategy

5. **Created MainLayoutContainer smart component**:
   - `/src/features/main-layout/main-layout-container.ts` - Root application container
   - Integrated MainLayoutStore with dependency injection
   - Implemented loading, error, and ready state rendering
   - Added ngOnInit lifecycle for data loading initialization
   - Integrated HeroSection component

6. **Updated story documentation**:
   - Marked all 27 tasks and subtasks as completed
   - Changed status from "Approved" to "Done"
   - Added comprehensive completion summary with file listings

### ✅ Quality Checks Passed:

- **TypeScript compilation** - ✅ PASSED (pnpm run build)
- **ESLint** - ✅ PASSED (pnpm run lint) - Fixed all component selector prefixes and void expression issues
- **Circular dependency check** - ✅ PASSED (pnpm run madge)

### ✅ Story Requirements Met:

- **AC 1: MainLayoutContainer component created** - ✅ Smart component with application shell structure
- **AC 2: main-layout-store.ts created** - ✅ Follows AIBD Simple Store Pattern exactly
- **AC 3: Store loads data from JSON files** - ✅ Implemented with forkJoin from /assets/ directory, converts DTO to VM types
- **AC 4: Store implements recipe filtering logic** - ✅ Shows recipes containing ALL selected ingredients
- **AC 5: HeroSection component created** - ✅ Displays welcome message and introduction
- **AC 6: Store follows AIBD Simple Store pattern** - ✅ Uses signalState, patchState, computed selectors, rxMethod effects
- **AC 7: Store complies with store design** - ✅ Implements MainLayoutStoreDesign type alias with all required properties

The story has been moved to **Done** status and is ready for integration with future story components. The implementation successfully addresses the original main layout and state management requirements with a solid foundation for recipe search functionality.
