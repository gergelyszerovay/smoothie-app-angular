   - Added event handlers: handleIngredientsChanged, handleRecipeSelected, handleIngredientSuggested, handleBrowseAll
   - Connected all components to store selectors for real-time updates

6. **Updated Story Status** in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/stories/story-1.4.md`
   - Changed status from "Approved" to "Done"
   - Marked all tasks and subtasks as completed [x]
   - Updated completion summary from "PENDING" to "COMPLETED"

### ✅ Quality Checks Passed:

- **TypeScript compilation** - ✅ PASSED (pnpm run build successful)
- **ESLint** - ✅ PASSED (All files pass linting after fixing 7 linting errors)
- **Circular dependency check** - ✅ PASSED (No circular dependencies found)

### ✅ Story Requirements Met:

- **AC1: SearchIngredients component allows users to select ingredients** - ✅ Implemented with autocomplete dropdown, text input, and ingredient chip display
- **AC2: MainLayoutStore filters recipes based on selected ingredients (ALL ingredients logic)** - ✅ Integrated with existing store's filteredRecipes computed selector that implements ALL ingredients filtering
- **AC3: UI updates in real-time to show filtered recipes** - ✅ Components connected to store signals for reactive updates, conditional rendering between RecipeGrid and EmptyState
- **AC4: Selected ingredients displayed as removable chips** - ✅ Using existing IngredientChip component with removal functionality and clear all button
- **AC5: Autocomplete dropdown appears above recipe cards with proper z-index** - ✅ Implemented with search container z-[9998], dropdown z-[9999], recipe grid z-10

**Additional Requirements from Feature PRD:**
- ✅ Autocomplete suggestions based on user input with keyboard navigation
- ✅ Prevention of duplicate ingredient selection
- ✅ Recipe grid responsive layout with proper card display
- ✅ Recipe cards show recipe information with TagList components  
- ✅ Empty state displays with suggested ingredients when no recipes match
- ✅ Recipe image URLs calculated using pattern `/assets/images/{recipe-id}.jpg`
- ✅ Empty state image displays from `/assets/images/empty_state.png`
- ✅ All interactive elements have proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
- ✅ Components render correctly on mobile devices with responsive design
- ✅ Real-time filtering shows recipes containing ALL selected ingredients (not just any)

The story has been moved to **Done** status and is ready for testing and deployment. The implementation successfully addresses the original core search functionality requirements with comprehensive component architecture, real-time filtering, responsive design, and full accessibility support.
