# Story 1.5: Implement Recipe Display

## Story Information

- **Epic**: 1
- **Story Number**: 1.5
- **Status**: Done

## Story Description

**As a** user  
**I want** to see the search results displayed in a clear and organized grid  
**So that** I can easily browse and select a recipe to view

## Business Context

This story completes the MVP by implementing the recipe display functionality that allows users to view detailed recipe information. The story builds upon the existing recipe search functionality (Story 1.4) to provide users with comprehensive recipe details through a modal interface. This is the final component needed to deliver a fully functional smoothie recipe discovery experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `RecipeModal` component displays the full details of a selected recipe
2. The modal shows recipe name, description, ingredients with amounts and units, preparation instructions (pro tips), and tags
3. The modal includes a recipe image loaded from the assets directory using the pattern `/assets/images/{recipe-id}.jpg`
4. The modal can be opened by clicking on recipe cards and closed by user interaction
5. The modal uses proper z-index layering according to the project's z-index hierarchy (z-index: 9999)
6. The modal is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices
7. The modal provides proper keyboard navigation and accessibility support with ARIA attributes
8. The modal integrates seamlessly with the existing MainLayoutContainer state management

### Design Documents

- `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/components/app/main-layout-container/recipe-modal/recipe-modal.md`

## Technical Requirements

### Data Models

- Uses existing `RecipeVM` type from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/data-structures/recipe-vm.md`
- Uses existing `TagVM` type from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/data-structures/tag-vm.md`
- Uses existing `RecipeIngredientVM` nested type for ingredient display

### API Changes

- No new API endpoints required
- Integrates with existing MainLayout store state management
- Uses existing recipe data loaded from static JSON files

### UI/UX Requirements

- Modal overlay with backdrop for proper user focus
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Recipe image display with fallback handling
- Ingredients list with proper formatting (amount, unit, ingredient name with emoji)
- Pro tips section displaying helpful preparation advice
- Tags display using existing TagList shared component
- Close button or click-outside functionality for modal dismissal

### Security Considerations

- No additional security requirements beyond existing application standards
- Image paths are static and calculated client-side from recipe ID

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Architecture Notes

- Follow single-file component pattern with inline template and styles
- Use Angular signals for reactive state management where applicable
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for optimal performance
- Modal should be a presentational component that emits events to parent

### Code Organization

- Create the component in `/src/features/recipe-display/recipe-modal.ts`
- Use kebab-case naming convention for component selector
- Import shared types from their absolute paths using project path aliases
- Follow AIBD directory structure guidelines with no barrel files

### External Dependencies

- Uses existing TagList shared component for tags display
- Leverages Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Integrates with Angular's reactive forms and signals system
- No additional third-party dependencies required

### Performance Considerations

- Use OnPush change detection to minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Implement efficient image loading with proper fallback handling
- Optimize modal animations and transitions for smooth user experience
- Consider lazy loading of modal content if performance issues arise

### Error Handling

- Handle missing recipe data gracefully (null/undefined checks)
- Provide fallback behavior for missing recipe images
- Implement proper error boundaries for component failures
- Log meaningful error messages for debugging

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach should focus on component behavior, user interactions, and integration with the parent MainLayout component. Key areas to test include:

1. **Component Rendering**: Verify modal renders correctly with recipe data
2. **User Interactions**: Test modal open/close functionality and event emissions  
3. **Responsive Behavior**: Validate layout adapts properly to different screen sizes
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
5. **Integration**: Confirm proper data flow with MainLayoutContainer
