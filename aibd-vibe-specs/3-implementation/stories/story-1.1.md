# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

## Story Information

- **Epic**: 1
- **Story Number**: 1.1
- **Status**: Done

## Story Description

**As a** developer  
**I want** to verify the existing Angular project boilerplate is properly configured and buildable  
**So that** I have a stable foundation for building the application

## Business Context

This story establishes the foundational requirements for the entire Smoothie Recipe MVP. It ensures that the development environment is properly configured, all necessary data files are in place, and the build system works correctly. This is critical for all subsequent development work as it validates the basic project setup and ensures all developers can start work on a stable foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The project builds successfully with `ng build` without any errors.
2. No circular dependencies exist in the codebase.
3. All linting rules pass with `ng lint` without any errors or warnings.
4. All JSON data files (`recipes.json`, `ingredients.json`, `tags.json`) are present in the application's assets directory (`src/assets`).
5. All recipe images from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/sample-data/images` are present in the `src/assets/images` directory.

  - [x] Subtask 4.3.2: Verify test environment is properly configured

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Architecture Notes

This story focuses on infrastructure and foundation setup rather than feature development. The Angular project should follow the AIBD directory structure as defined in `/workspace/aibd/guidelines/architect-directory-structure.md`:

- `/src/features/` contains feature-specific code
- `/src/shared/` contains reusable components and utilities  
- `/src/assets/` contains static files (JSON data, images)
- No additional top-level directories in `/src/`

### Code Organization

All JSON data files must be placed in `src/assets/` directory for proper access by the Angular HTTP client:
- `src/assets/recipes.json` - Recipe data with ingredients, instructions, and metadata
- `src/assets/ingredients.json` - Available ingredients with names and emojis
- `src/assets/tags.json` - Recipe tags with names and colors
- `src/assets/images/` - Recipe images referenced by JSON data

### External Dependencies

This story uses the existing Angular project dependencies:
- Angular CLI for build tools
- ESLint for code linting
- TypeScript compiler for type checking
- No additional dependencies should be added in this story

### Performance Considerations

- All static assets should be optimized for web delivery
- JSON files should be properly structured for efficient parsing
- Images should be web-optimized formats (JPEG, PNG)

### Error Handling

- Build errors must be resolved for project foundation
- Asset loading issues must be identified and fixed
- Any configuration problems must be addressed

## Testing Strategy

Since this is infrastructure setup, testing focuses on:
1. **Build Verification**: Ensure the project compiles successfully
2. **Asset Verification**: Confirm all data files and images are accessible
3. **Quality Verification**: Validate code meets linting standards
4. **Development Environment**: Verify development server runs correctly

- Development environment validation
- Code quality standards compliance

### Completion Summary

**COMPLETED**: All acceptance criteria have been met:
- Project builds without errors using `pnpm run build`
- No circular dependencies found using `pnpm run madge`
- All linting passes without errors using `pnpm run lint`
- All JSON data files (recipes.json, ingredients.json, tags.json) copied to src/assets/
- All recipe images copied to src/assets/images/
- Build output includes all assets correctly
- Development foundation is stable and ready for feature development

### Implementation Details

The project foundation setup has been successfully completed with all tasks verified:

2. **Code Quality**: ESLint passes with no errors or warnings
3. **Dependencies**: No circular dependencies detected
4. **Assets**: All sample data and images properly organized in src/assets/
5. **Build Output**: Assets correctly included in distribution build

The development environment is now ready for implementing smoothie recipe application features.
