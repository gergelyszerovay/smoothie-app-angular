## 1. Home/Search Page

```
Design a responsive web app home page for a Smoothie Recipe platform.
- At the top, include a prominent multi-select ingredient search bar with autocomplete and clear button, labeled "Ingredients you have".

- Each recipe card should show:
    - A smoothie image (use a placeholder if needed)
    - The recipe name (prominent)
    - A short description
    - Tags as small chips or badges (e.g., vegan, breakfast, summer)
- Do not include tag filter chips or tag selection in the search view.
- Add a persistent top navigation bar with the app logo/title and navigation link (Home).
- Include a friendly empty state illustration and message if no recipes match the filters.
- Use a modern, clean style with accessible color contrast and rounded corners.
