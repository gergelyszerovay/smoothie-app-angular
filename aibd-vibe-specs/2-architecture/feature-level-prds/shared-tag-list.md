# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature: TagList (shared-tag-list)

---

### 1. Objective

The TagList component provides a reusable container for displaying collections of Tag components in a horizontal layout. It manages the arrangement and spacing of multiple tags, ensuring consistent presentation across recipe cards, modals, and other UI elements. This component serves as the primary mechanism for displaying recipe categories and attributes in a visually organized manner.

---

### 2. User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to see recipe tags organized in a clean, horizontal layout so that I can quickly scan recipe categories.
- **As a user**, I want to see multiple tags displayed with proper spacing so that I can distinguish between different recipe attributes.
- **As a developer**, I want a reusable tag list container so that I can maintain consistent tag layout across the application.

### 3. Requirements

#### 3.1. Functional Requirements

1. **Tag Collection Display:**

   - The component MUST display an array of Tag components as specified in the TagVM data structure.
   - The component MUST arrange tags in a horizontal layout with appropriate spacing.

2. **Layout Management:**

   - The component MUST handle responsive wrapping when container width is insufficient.
   - The component MUST maintain consistent spacing between individual tags.

3. **Container Behavior:**
   - The component MUST act as a display-only container without direct interaction.
   - The component MUST pass through tag data to individual Tag components.

#### 3.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Performance:** Component must render efficiently with minimal re-renders when tag list changes.
- **Usability:** Must provide clear visual separation between tags while maintaining readability.
- **Accessibility:** Must support screen readers with proper semantic markup for tag collections.
- **Responsiveness:** Must adapt to different screen sizes with appropriate wrapping behavior.
- **Styling:** Must use Tailwind CSS utility classes as primary styling approach.

### 4. UI (User Interface)

#### 4.1. Design Specification References

**Component Specifications and Visual Design:** Reference `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/components/shared/tag-list/tag-list.md` for component behavior, inputs, outputs, and states

**Data Structures:** Reference `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/data-structures/tag-vm.md` for type definitions

**Component Hierarchy:** Contains multiple Tag components, used by RecipeCard and RecipeModal components

#### 4.2. Feature-Specific Implementation

**Custom Components:** TagList component implementing design specification for tag collection display

**Business Logic:** No business logic required (pure presentational component)

**State Management:** Component state handled internally with signals for layout and rendering

**Data Flow:** Coordinates with parent components for data, receives tag data from MainLayout component

**Layout Behavior:**

- Horizontal arrangement of tags with consistent spacing
- Responsive wrapping to new lines when container width is exceeded
- Proper alignment and spacing between tags

**Visual States:**

- Default state with horizontal tag layout
- Responsive state with wrapped layout on smaller screens
