# Checklist: Feature-Level Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This checklist is designed to verify the completeness and clarity of a feature-level PRD.

---

### 1. Header & Objective

- [ ] **Feature Name:** The PRD has a clear, concise title for the feature.
- [ ] **Objective:** The "Objective" section clearly and succinctly explains the purpose of the feature and the value it delivers. It answers the "why" of the feature.

---

### 2. User Stories

- [ ] **Completeness:** User stories cover the primary user interactions and goals related to the feature.
- [ ] **Format:** Stories follow the standard "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]" format.
- [ ] **Clarity:** Each user story is unambiguous and testable.
- [ ] **System Stories:** Includes stories for system-driven actions where applicable (e.g., "As a System, I want...").

### 3. Requirements

#### 3.1. Functional Requirements

- [ ] **Clarity:** Each requirement is stated clearly and unambiguously, using "MUST", "SHOULD", or "MAY".
- [ ] **Atomicity:** Each requirement describes a single piece of functionality.
- [ ] **Testability:** It is possible to verify whether the requirement has been met.
- [ ] **Coverage:** Functional requirements cover all user stories and primary feature aspects.
- [ ] **Edge Cases:** Obvious edge cases and error states are considered and defined (e.g., invalid input, failed validation).
- [ ] **Data Flow:** For features involving data manipulation, the flow of data is clear (e.g., what happens on successful submission).

#### 3.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- [ ] **Comprehensiveness:** Key NFRs are addressed.
  - [ ] **Security:** Security considerations (e.g., HTTPS, data protection) are specified.
  - [ ] **Usability:** Usability aspects (e.g., simplicity, clarity of messages) are defined.
  - [ ] **Performance:** Performance expectations (e.g., response times) are set where applicable.
  - [ ] **Responsiveness:** Requirements for different screen sizes are defined.
  - [ ] **Styling:** Adherence to design systems or style guides is mentioned.
  - [ ] **Testing:** The expected level of testing (unit, integration, E2E) is outlined.

---

### 4. UI (User Interface)

- [ ] **Specificity:** The UI section describes the necessary components and their layout.
- [ ] **Component Breakdown:** Key UI elements (e.g., cards, forms, buttons, alerts) are listed.
- [ ] **Clarity:** The description is clear enough for a developer or designer to build a wireframe or initial version.
- [ ] **Consistency:** The described UI is consistent with the functional requirements.

---

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Format:** Presented as a checklist of verifiable outcomes.
- [ ] **Alignment:** Each item directly corresponds to a functional or non-functional requirement.
- [ ] **User-Centric:** Criteria are written from the perspective of an end-user or the system's observable behavior.
- [ ] **Clarity:** Each criterion is a clear, binary (pass/fail) statement.
- [ ] **Coverage:** All major success and failure scenarios from the requirements are covered.

---

### 6. Directory Structure

- [ ] **Inclusion:** A proposed directory structure for the feature's code is included.
- [ ] **Clarity:** The structure is presented clearly (e.g., using a code block).
- [ ] **File Explanations:** The purpose of each new file is briefly explained.
- [ ] **Convention:** The structure follows established project conventions (e.g., separation of public/internal components).

---

### 7. Out of Scope

- [ ] **Clarity:** The "Out of Scope" section is present and clearly defines what will **not** be built.
- [ ] **Boundaries:** This section helps to set clear boundaries for the feature, preventing scope creep.
- [ ] **Related Features:** It identifies related functionalities that are intentionally being deferred or are part of other features.
