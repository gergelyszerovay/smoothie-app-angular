# `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs` Directory structure

List of the documentation files: `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/index.md`

## Project-Level Documentation

Located in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/`:

- **[tech-stack.md](/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/2-architecture/tech-stack.md)**: This document provides a comprehensive overview of the technical stack used in the project.

- **[z-index.md](/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/2-architecture/z-index.md)**: This document defines the z-index hierarchy and standards for proper UI layering across all components in the application.

## Design Specifications Organization

The `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/` directory contains comprehensive design specifications that serve as the authoritative source for UI implementation. This directory is organized as follows:

### Core Design Files

- **[project-brief.md](/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/project-brief.md)**: This Project Brief provides the full context for the project. It describes the problem, vision, goals, target users, key features, technical constraints, and relevant research for the project.

- **[component-tree.md](/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/component-tree.md)**: The single source of truth for the application's component hierarchy. This file defines the complete structure of UI components, their relationships, and organization into shared vs. application-specific components.

- **[sitemap.md](/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/sitemap.md)**: Provides a high-level overview of the application's structure, including a sitemap diagram and detailed table of all core application routes.

- **[html-prototype-overview.md](/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/html-prototype-overview.md)**: An automated overview of component structures found in static HTML prototypes, generated by scanning for `data-component` attributes.

### Component Specifications

Located in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/components/`:

- **`/shared/`**: Contains specifications for reusable, presentational components that can be used across multiple features. These are typically "dumb" components focused on visual presentation.
- **`/app/`**: Contains specifications for application-specific components that compose shared components into larger features. These are often "smart" container components.

Each component specification follows a standardized template with sections for Role, Inputs, Outputs, States, and Visual Reference.

### Static HTML Prototypes

Located in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/html-prototypes/`:

- **High-fidelity prototypes**: Static HTML files that serve as visual references for component design
- **Component marking**: Elements are marked with `data-component` attributes to associate them with component specifications
- **Design system compliance**: Prototypes use Tailwind CSS and follow established design patterns
- **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support

### Data Structures

Located in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/data-structures/`:

- **ViewModel definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for UI data structures, suffixed with `VM`
- **Documentation**: Each data structure includes property descriptions and usage examples

### Design Tools

- **[prototype-generator.prompts.md](/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/prototype-generator.prompts.md)**: Prompts and guidelines for generating HTML prototypes

## Epics

All epics **MUST** be stored in the following directory:
`/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/epics/`

The filename for each epic **MUST** follow the conventions below.

**Format:** `epic-<nn>.md`

Where `<nn>` is the number of the epic, for example: `epic-3.md`

## Stories

All stories **MUST** be stored in the following directory:
`/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/stories/`

The filename for each epic **MUST** follow the conventions below.

**Format:** `story-<epicId>.<nn>.md`

Where `<epicId>` is the number of the epic and `<nn>` is the number of the story, for example: `story-1.3.md`, the third story of the first epic.
