# Autonomous Implement Next Story Task Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive validation framework for autonomous agents implementing story tasks. The agent should systematically work through each item to ensure the implementation meets all requirements and quality standards.

## 1. STORY IDENTIFICATION & PREPARATION

- [x] Next story task has been identified from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/stories/`
- [x] Story file has been read and understood completely
- [x] All acceptance criteria are clearly identified
- [x] Task breakdown and technical guidance are reviewed
- [x] Dependencies and prerequisites are understood

## 2. REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTATION

- [x] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented
- [x] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met
- [x] Edge cases and error conditions are handled gracefully
- [x] Implementation follows the technical guidance provided
- [x] All tasks within the story are completed

## 3. COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION

- [x] Feature level PRD has been read and understood
- [x] Design documentation in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design` has been reviewed
- [x] Component specifications in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/components` have been consulted
- [x] HTML prototypes in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/html-prototypes` have been examined if referenced
- [x] Elements with `data-component` attributes have been identified in HTML prototypes
- [x] Component follows Angular standalone component pattern
- [x] Component uses `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- [x] Component implements `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`
- [x] Component uses signals for state management where applicable
- [x] Component follows naming conventions (descriptive names for dumb components, Container suffix for smart components)

## 4. STORE IMPLEMENTATION

- [x] Store design documentation in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/2-architecture/store-designs` has been read
- [x] AIBD simple store pattern from `/workspace/aibd/blueprints/angular-tailwind/aibd-simple-store.md` has been followed
- [x] Store uses signals for state management
- [x] Store implements proper state immutability (using `update` or `set` instead of `mutate`)
- [x] Store follows single responsibility principle
- [x] Store is provided at appropriate level (root or feature-specific)

## 5. CODING STANDARDS & PROJECT STRUCTURE

- [x] All new/modified code adheres to Operational Guidelines
- [x] Code aligns with Project Structure (file locations, naming conventions)
- [x] Tech Stack requirements followed for technologies/versions used
- [x] API Reference and Data Models followed for relevant changes
- [x] Basic security best practices applied (input validation, error handling, no hardcoded secrets)
- [x] Code is well-commented where necessary (complex logic, not obvious statements)

## 6. QUALITY ASSURANCE & TESTING

- [x] Project builds successfully without errors (`pnpm run build`)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (verified by `pnpm run build`)
- [x] ESLint passes without new errors or warnings (`pnpm run lint`)
- [x] Circular dependency check passes (`pnpm run madge`)
- [x] No new linter errors or warnings introduced

## 7. FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

- [x] Functionality has been manually verified (running app locally, testing endpoints)
- [x] All story acceptance criteria have been validated
- [x] Integration points work correctly with existing system
- [x] Error handling works as expected
- [x] Performance considerations addressed where relevant

## 8. DEPENDENCIES & CONFIGURATION

- [x] Any new dependencies are documented and justified
- [x] New dependencies recorded in appropriate files (package.json, etc.)
- [x] No known security vulnerabilities in new dependencies
- [x] Environment variables or configurations documented securely
- [x] Build configuration updated if necessary

## 9. STORY ADMINISTRATION

- [x] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete
- [x] Story status updated to 'Done'
- [x] Development decisions and clarifications documented in story file
- [x] Story wrap-up section completed with relevant notes
- [x] Agent model used during development documented
- [x] Changelog properly updated with implementation changes

## 10. CODE DOCUMENTATION

- [x] Inline code documentation (TSDoc) completed for new functions and classes
- [x] Complex logic documented with appropriate comments
- [x] Code is self-documenting with clear variable and function names
- [x] No external technical documentation updates required (handled by architect)

## 11. FILE MANAGEMENT & OUTPUT

- [x] Only story-specific files modified (no project documentation changes)
- [x] Story markdown file updated with implementation details
- [x] All changes properly committed with descriptive messages
- [x] File structure maintained according to project standards

## 12. TASK REPORT GENERATION

- [x] Task report created using specified template
- [x] All changes made are documented specifically
- [x] Quality checks results included
- [x] Story requirements satisfaction documented
- [x] Implementation summary accurately reflects work completed

## 13. FINAL VALIDATION

- [x] All applicable checklist items have been addressed
- [x] Story is ready for review or next phase
- [x] No blocking issues remain unresolved
- [x] Implementation meets all defined quality standards
- [x] Story can be considered complete and ready for deployment
