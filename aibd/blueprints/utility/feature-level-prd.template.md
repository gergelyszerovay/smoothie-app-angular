# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature: [Feature Name] ([feature-name-slug])

---

### 1. Objective

_A brief, one-paragraph summary of the feature's purpose. What core problem does it solve within the application? What is its primary responsibility?_

---

### 2. System Stories

_List the system-level stories that this feature addresses. Focus on how other parts of the system will interact with this utility._

- **As a [system component/feature]**, I want to **[use this utility to perform an action]** so that **[a technical goal is achieved]**.
- **As a developer**, I want **[this utility to provide a clear API]** so that **[I can integrate it easily]**.

### 3. Requirements

#### 3.1. Functional Requirements

_Detail the specific, testable functionalities. Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)._

1.  **Public API:**
    - The feature MUST expose the following functions/modules: `[functionA, functionB]`.
    - The function `functionA` MUST accept `[parameters]` and return `[return type]`.
2.  **Core Logic:**
    - The utility MUST correctly implement `[describe the core algorithm or logic]`.
3.  **Data Structures:**
    - The feature MUST define and use the `[TypeName]` data structure.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    - The utility MUST handle `[specific error condition]` and return/throw `[expected error]`.

#### 3.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Performance:** Describe performance expectations (e.g., execution time, memory footprint).
- **Reliability:** Define expected uptime, reliability, and error rates.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured and documented.

---

### 4. Technical Design

_Provide a high-level overview of the implementation strategy. Describe the main components, data structures, and their interactions._

- **Data Structures:**
  - `TypeName`: Describe the purpose and structure of key data types.
- **Core Components:**
  - `moduleOrFileName.ts`: Explain its responsibility and public interface.
- **Key Algorithms:**
  - Briefly describe any complex algorithms or logic.

---

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

_A checklist of observable outcomes that must be met for the feature to be considered complete. Focus on API contracts and behavior._

- [ ] `functionA` returns the expected output for valid inputs.
- [ ] `functionA` throws a specific error for invalid inputs.
- [ ] The feature correctly handles edge case `[X]`.
- [ ] All public functions are exported correctly.
- [ ] The feature integrates correctly with `[dependent feature]`.

---

### 6. Directory Structure

_Propose the file and directory structure for the new feature, explaining the purpose of each file._

```
src/features/[feature-name-slug]/
├── publicFunctionA.ts    # Description of its purpose.
├── publicFunctionB.ts    # Description of its purpose.
└── internal/
    ├── coreLogic.ts      # Description of the internal logic.
    └── dataTypes.ts      # Description of internal data structures.
```

**File Explanations:**

- **`publicFunctionA.ts`**: Explanation.
- **`internal/coreLogic.ts`**: Explanation.

---

### 7. Out of Scope

_Clearly define what this feature will **not** include._

- Functionality X (this will be handled by another feature).
- UI components for this logic.
