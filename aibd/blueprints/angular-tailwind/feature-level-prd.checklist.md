---

### 2. User Stories

- [ ] **Completeness:** User stories cover the primary user interactions and goals related to the feature.
- [ ] **Format:** Stories follow the standard "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]" format.
- [ ] **Clarity:** Each user story is unambiguous and testable.
- [ ] **System Stories:** Includes stories for system-driven actions where applicable (e.g., "As a System, I want...").

### 3. Requirements

#### 3.1. Functional Requirements

- [ ] **Clarity:** Each requirement is stated clearly and unambiguously, using "MUST", "SHOULD", or "MAY".
- [ ] **Atomicity:** Each requirement describes a single piece of functionality.
- [ ] **Testability:** It is possible to verify whether the requirement has been met.
- [ ] **Coverage:** Functional requirements cover all user stories and primary feature aspects.
- [ ] **Edge Cases:** Obvious edge cases and error states are considered and defined (e.g., invalid input, failed validation).
- [ ] **Data Flow:** For features involving data manipulation, the flow of data is clear (e.g., what happens on successful submission).

#### 3.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- [ ] **Comprehensiveness:** Key NFRs are addressed.
  - [ ] **Security:** Security considerations (e.g., HTTPS, data protection) are specified.
  - [ ] **Usability:** Usability aspects (e.g., simplicity, clarity of messages) are defined.
  - [ ] **Performance:** Performance expectations (e.g., response times) are set where applicable.
  - [ ] **Responsiveness:** Requirements for different screen sizes are defined.
  - [ ] **Styling:** Adherence to Tailwind CSS utility classes and design system is mentioned.

### 4. UI (User Interface)

#### 4.1. Design Specification References

- [ ] **Component Specifications:** The feature references `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/components/` for component behavior, inputs, outputs, and states.
- [ ] **Visual Design:** The feature references `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/html-prototypes/` for visual appearance and layout.
- [ ] **Data Structures:** The feature references `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/data-structures/` for type definitions and data models.
- [ ] **Component Hierarchy:** The feature references `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/component-tree.md` for component relationships.
- [ ] **No Duplication:** The feature does not duplicate content from design specifications.
- [ ] **No Input/Output Details:** The feature does not specify component inputs and outputs (covered in design specs).

#### 4.2. Implementation Requirements

- [ ] **Angular Implementation:** The feature specifies Angular-specific implementation details (component structure, lifecycle, patterns).
- [ ] **Service Layer:** The feature defines business logic, data management, and data fetching requirements.
- [ ] **State Management:** The feature specifies state handling, data flow, and component communication patterns.
- [ ] **Integration Patterns:** The feature describes how components coordinate and share data.

#### 4.3. Implementation Guidelines

- [ ] **Angular Components:** The feature creates Angular components that match the design specifications.
- [ ] **Single-File Components:** The feature uses single-file components with inline template and styles.
- [ ] **Component File Structure:** The feature uses separate HTML/CSS files only for components with >50 lines template or >100 lines styles.
- [ ] **Smart Component Naming:** The feature uses "-container" suffix for smart components (with state management or services).
- [ ] **Store Integration:** The feature uses stores for complex state management following signal store patterns.
- [ ] **Tailwind Styling:** The feature uses Tailwind utility classes as the primary styling approach.
- [ ] **Custom CSS:** Component CSS files are used only for design elements not achievable with Tailwind utilities.
- [ ] **Responsive Design:** The feature implements responsive behavior as shown in the HTML prototypes.
- [ ] **Accessibility:** The feature ensures proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation as specified in design.

#### 4.4. Feature-Specific Implementation

- [ ] **Custom Components:** Any new components not covered by design specifications are clearly described.
- [ ] **Business Logic:** Feature-specific business rules and data processing are defined.
- [ ] **State Management:** The feature describes how it manages application state.
- [ ] **Data Flow:** The feature explains how data flows between components and services.
- [ ] **Data Sources:** The feature specifies where data is fetched from (e.g., `/assets/` folder, APIs, services).

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Format:** Presented as a checklist of verifiable outcomes.
- [ ] **Alignment:** Each item directly corresponds to a functional or non-functional requirement.
- [ ] **User-Centric:** Criteria are written from the perspective of an end-user or the system's observable behavior.
- [ ] **Clarity:** Each criterion is a clear, binary (pass/fail) statement.
- [ ] **Coverage:** All major success and failure scenarios from the requirements are covered.

---

### 6. Directory Structure

- [ ] **Inclusion:** A proposed directory structure for the feature's code is included.
- [ ] **Clarity:** The structure is presented clearly (e.g., using a code block).
- [ ] **File Explanations:** The purpose of each new file is briefly explained.
- [ ] **Implementation Paths:** The structure correctly distinguishes between:
  - [ ] **Feature Components:** Non-shared components in `/src/features/[feature-name]/`
  - [ ] **Shared Components:** Reusable components in `/src/shared/[shared-feature-name]/`
- [ ] **Angular Convention:** The structure follows established Angular project conventions:
  - [ ] **Component Files:** Uses `.ts` for components with inline templates and styles.
  - [ ] **Service Files:** Includes `.service.ts` and `.service.spec.ts` where applicable.
  - [ ] **Store Files:** Includes `.store.ts` and `.store.spec.ts` for signal stores.
  - [ ] **Naming Convention:** Files follow Angular naming conventions with feature name prefix.
- [ ] **Design Specification Integration:** The structure references the corresponding design specification components:
  - [ ] **Design Component:** References components from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/component-tree.md`.
  - [ ] **Design Spec:** Follows specifications in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/components/`.
  - [ ] **Visual Reference:** Matches HTML prototypes in `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/html-prototypes/`.
  - [ ] **Data Types:** Uses ViewModels from `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/data-structures/`.

### 7. Out of Scope

- [ ] **Clarity:** The "Out of Scope" section is present and clearly defines what will **not** be built.
- [ ] **Boundaries:** This section helps to set clear boundaries for the feature, preventing scope creep.
- [ ] **Related Features:** It identifies related functionalities that are intentionally being deferred or are part of other features.
