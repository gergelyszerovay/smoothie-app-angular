### 3. Requirements

#### 3.1. Functional Requirements

_Detail the specific, testable functionalities. Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)._

1.  **Requirement 1:**
    - The system MUST...
2.  **Requirement 2:**
    - The system SHOULD...
3.  **Requirement 3:**
    - The interface MUST allow the user to...

#### 3.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Performance:** Describe performance expectations (e.g., page load times, API response times).
- **Usability:** Describe usability considerations (e.g., intuitive design, clear error messaging).
- **Security:** Outline security requirements (e.g., authentication, data validation, protection against common vulnerabilities).
- **Accessibility:** Specify accessibility standards to be met (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA).
- **Responsiveness:** Define behavior across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Styling:** Note any specific styling guidelines or adherence to a design system (e.g., Tailwind CSS utility classes, custom design tokens).
- **Testing:** Outline the required testing strategy (e.g., unit tests for components and services, integration tests for component interactions, E2E tests for user flows).

---

### 4. UI (User Interface)

_Describe the UI components, layout, and user flow by referencing the existing design specifications._

#### 4.1. Design Specification References

**MUST** reference the authoritative design specifications without duplicating their content:

- **Component Specifications:** Reference `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/components/` for component behavior, inputs, outputs, and states
- **Visual Design:** Reference `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/html-prototypes/` for visual appearance and layout
- **Data Structures:** Reference `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/data-structures/` for type definitions and data models
- **Component Hierarchy:** Reference `/workspace/aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/component-tree.md` for component relationships

#### 4.2. Feature-Specific Implementation

**SHOULD** describe implementation details specific to this feature:

- **Custom Components:** Any new components not covered by design specifications
- **Business Logic:** Feature-specific business rules and data processing
- **State Management:** How the feature manages application state
- **Data Flow:** How data flows between components and services
- **Data Sources:** Where data is fetched from (e.g., `/assets/` folder, APIs, services)

---

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

_A checklist of observable outcomes that must be met for the feature to be considered complete. Each item should be a binary (pass/fail) statement._

- [ ] A user can successfully...
- [ ] The system correctly validates...
- [ ] An error is displayed when...
- [ ] The UI is responsive on...
- [ ] All interactive elements are fully accessible.

---

### 6. Directory Structure

_Propose the file and directory structure for the new feature's code, following the blueprint's implementation guidelines._

**MUST** follow the directory structure and file naming conventions defined in the blueprint's implementation guidelines.

---

### 7. Out of Scope

_Clearly define what this feature will **not** include. This helps prevent scope creep and sets clear boundaries._

- Functionality X (this will be handled by another feature).
- Advanced feature Y (this is a potential future enhancement).
- User role Z management.
