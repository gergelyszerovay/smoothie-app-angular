# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Sitemap and Core Routes

This document provides a high-level overview of the application's structure, including a sitemap diagram and a detailed table of all core application routes.

## Core Application Routes

This section lists the primary routes for the application, informed by the PRDs and Epics.

<!--
  The {{ROUTES_TABLE}} placeholder should be replaced with a markdown table
  containing the following columns: Path, Component, Feature, Description, and Access Control.
  Example:
  | Path | Component | Feature | Description | Access Control |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | / | HomePage | public-home | Main landing page. | Public |
  | /admin | AdminDashboardPage | admin-shell | Main admin dashboard. | Admin Only |
-->

## Site Map / Screen Inventory

This diagram visualizes the primary screens of the application and their relationships.

<!--
  The {{SITEMAP_DIAGRAM}} placeholder should be replaced with a MermaidJS
  `graph TD` diagram. Nodes should be quoted to allow for newlines.
  Use the format "Screen Name
(/route/path)" for nodes with routes (use actual newlines, not \n).
  Example:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A["Homepage
(/)"]
      A --> B["Search Results

(/search)"]

      J["Admin Login

(/login)"] --> K["Admin Dashboard
(/admin)"]

```
-->
{{SITEMAP_DIAGRAM}}
```
