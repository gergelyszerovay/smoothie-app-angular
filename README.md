> **Beyond vibe coding: enter vibe specifications - where AI agents transform design intent into reality**

This project demonstrates building an Angular application based on specifications in `/aibd-vibe-specs` using AI agents. The Angular application in `/src` is generated by autonomous agents, based on the specifications.

The project uses the **AIBD (AI-Based Development)** method, with the AIBD framework and guidelines in [`/aibd`](aibd). The specifications in [`/aibd-vibe-specs`](aibd-vibe-specs) are **vibe specifications**, generated and maintained by prompting and AI agents.

## About the Smoothie App

The smoothie app is a recipe management application that allows users to:

- Browse and search smoothie recipes
- View recipe details with ingredients and instructions
- Filter recipes by ingredients

### Architecture Patterns

The app follows patterns:

- **Smart/Dumb Components**: The architecture separates concerns between smart components (that handle business logic and state) and dumb components (that focus purely on presentation)
- **Signal-Based Store**: State management is handled using Angular's signal system for reactive, performant state updates
- **Modern Angular**: All components use modern Angular features including signals, `input()`, `output()`, standalone components, and native control flow

## Build Process

To build the application:

1. **Clone the specification branch**:

   ```bash
   git clone -b specification-001 https://github.com/gergelyszerovay/smoothie-app-angular /workspace
   ```

   **Note**: There is also an `implementation-001` branch containing the working, implemented application if you want to see the final result.

2. **Navigate to workspace and install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start Claude** and enter the following command:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

   Then enter:

   ```
   execute /workspace/aibd/tasks/create-and-implement-story-tasks-cc/task.md
   ```

This simple agent orchestrator will coordinate two sub-agents in a loop to create and implement story tasks. The sub-agents are located in [`/workspace/.claude/agents`](.claude/agents). It will walk through the stories of the epic, generate a story task from each story, then implement it. During the process, you can see:

- **Generated story tasks**: [`aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/stories/`](aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/stories/)
- **Sub-agent Reports**: [`aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/reports/`](aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/reports/)

## Requirements

- **Claude Pro subscription** (required for the AI agent workflow)
- **DevContainer**: [Claude Code DevContainer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/devcontainer)
- **Time**: Approximately 1 hour
- **Token usage**: ~20M tokens for the complete build process

## Code Generation Consistency

For each generation, the generated code will be similar, except for those parts that are not described in the specification, for example:

- **Loading states**: Implementation details for loading indicators and spinners
- **Error states**: Error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- **Empty state suggestions**: Which ingredients to suggest when no recipes are found

These unspecified elements may vary between generations as they require creative implementation decisions.

## Project Structure

- **Specifications**: [`aibd-vibe-specs`](aibd-vibe-specs) - Complete design and architecture specifications
  - **Design**: [`aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/`](aibd-vibe-specs/1-design/) - Component designs and HTML prototypes
  - **Architecture**: [`aibd-vibe-specs/2-architecture/`](aibd-vibe-specs/2-architecture/) - System architecture and store designs
  - **Implementation**: [`aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/`](aibd-vibe-specs/3-implementation/) - Story tasks and implementation reports

**Tip**: Read [`aibd/guidelines/general-documentation-structure.md`](aibd/guidelines/general-documentation-structure.md) to understand the specification's structure.

## Next Steps

- **Improve AIBD documentation**: Enhance the AIBD method documentation and guidelines
- **Optimize workflow**: Reduce token usage while maintaining consistent results
- **Publish AIBD guidelines**: Share more AIBD guidelines used for generating the specification
